So the first night isn't usually that bad so I'll just play through-
God give me voice, God guide my hand
How to make Trager juice.//Step 1: §oSqueeze
A reminder, in the event of a XK-class end-of-the-world scenario, don't panic!//It won't help. Nothing at all will help.//However, panicking will help probably the least.
Don't forget, today is pizza day!//So head on down to the cafeteria to grab yourself a hot slice!
Remember, security is the first step towards a safe work environment!//Stay secure, stay vigilant.
Feel tired and overworked?//Freshly brewed coffee is served at the cafeteria at all hours.
I am the cure.
Ring-a-ring o' roses.//A pocket full of posies.//A-tishoo. A-tishoo. We all fall down.
Reimagined!
Gott im Himmel.//You have become the host.
What Third World country made this drill.
Cloaker!
Shield!
I need a medic bag!
I need my pay day too.
Stop hitting yourself!//Stop hitting yourself!
You call this resisting arrest?//We call this a security tweak!
Hey what is that in the dista-
Every man has a beast within.//If you push too much, you might unleash the beast.
He's The Man, not Man From The Fog dammit!
